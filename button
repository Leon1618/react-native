Next you add the Button Core Component and give it an onPress prop:

<Button
  onPress={() => {
    setIsHungry(false);
  }}
  //..
/>

Now, when someone presses the button, onPress will fire, calling the setIsHungry(false). This sets the state variable isHungry to false. When isHungry is false, the Buttonâ€™s disabled prop is set to true and its title also changes:

<Button
  //..
  disabled={!isHungry}
  title={isHungry ? 'Pour me some milk, please!' : 'Thank you!'}
/>
